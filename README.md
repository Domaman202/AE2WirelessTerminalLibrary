AE2 Wireless Terminal Library fabric
====================================
This is an (unfinished) 1.16.5 fabric rewrite of https://github.com/p455w0rd/AE2WirelessTerminalLibrary

It will allow for easy addition of Infinite range-capable Wireless Terminals for AE2 with built-in Curios support.

A lot of stuff already works, tho there are still many bugs
